## Project Overview
This project examines Lebanon's declining happiness index, primarily attributed to the economic crisis that began in 2019. The analysis highlights GDP as a crucial factor influencing happiness and identifies its components, including government spending and investments, as significant contributors to the decline. Despite some positive trends in net exports, the report proposes targeted reforms to address these challenges and enhance happiness levels. By drawing comparisons with Singapore's fiscal reforms, the project underscores the importance of strategic economic policies to improve Lebanon's happiness index.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset, which provides comprehensive data on GDP, government spending, and other economic indicators. You can access the dataset here: [World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset](https://databankfiles.worldbank.org/public/ddpext_download/WH2.pdf).

## Tools + Purpose of Each
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning and preparation, including standardizing field names and filtering irrelevant data.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Employed for calculations and consolidating datasets spanning multiple years.
- **Tableau**: Utilized for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing complex relationships between happiness and economic indicators.
- **WordPress (AUBâ€™s Visualization Blogpost)**: Platform for sharing and disseminating the findings and dashboards.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning involved standardizing field names and filtering out irrelevant data from the Happiness Score dataset, which spans from 2015 to 2023. The data was consolidated into a comprehensive frame using Python and Excel, ensuring a clean and relevant dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Key questions addressed during the EDA include:
- How does GDP correlate with happiness scores in Lebanon?
- What trends are observable in the components of GDP, such as government spending and net exports?
- How do happiness trends in Lebanon compare to those in the MENA region and globally?

Visuals created in Tableau helped answer these questions by displaying trends and relationships between the happiness index and various economic factors.

## Data Analysis
The analysis revealed that:
- Happiness in Lebanon is strongly correlated with GDP.
- Government spending and investments have significantly decreased, impacting GDP negatively.
- Net exports have shown a positive trend but still remain negative.
- Comparisons with Singapore illustrate how fiscal reforms can positively impact economic and happiness metrics.

Interesting code snippets and visualizations from Tableau are included to demonstrate the analytical approach and findings.

## Results and Findings
1. **Primary Influencer**: GDP is the main factor affecting happiness in Lebanon.
2. **GDP Components**:
   - Consumption is stable.
   - Net Exports are improving but negative.
   - Government Spending and Investment have decreased significantly since 2019.
3. **Key Findings**: The decline in GDP due to reduced government spending and investment is critical. Positive trends in net exports offer potential for improvement.
4. **Reforms Needed**: Specific reforms are proposed to address these issues, including increasing foreign direct investment and enhancing government transparency.

## Recommendations
1. **Improving Private Investment**:
   - Simplify business registration and licensing processes.
   - Increase transparency and reduce taxes for new businesses.
   - Reinforce contracts and implement anti-discrimination policies.

2. **Increasing and Regulating Government Spending**:
   - Invest in health, education, and infrastructure.
   - Prioritize locally-made generics, renovate public schools and hospitals, and improve education infrastructure.

3. **Improving Net Exports**:
   - Implement protectionist trade policies to boost local production and competitiveness.

4. **Enhancing Transparency and Accountability**:
   - Strengthen auditing bodies and establish a national bureau of statistics for open data initiatives.

## Limitations
- The analysis is based on available data, which may not capture all relevant factors influencing happiness.
- Economic and political conditions are subject to change, which may impact the effectiveness of proposed reforms.
